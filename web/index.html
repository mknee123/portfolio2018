          <p class="margin-top">I am a Web Designer and Developer. Based in Pittsburgh, I work at a non-profit where I create, build and maintain websites with help from an awesome communications team. I obtained my web degree at <a href="https://www.ptcollege.edu/" target="_blank">Pittsburgh Technical Institute</a> (now Pittsburgh Technical College). I really love what I do. My other interests include a good video or board game, stretching at a yoga class, anything Sci-Fi related, reading a good adventure or thriller series and trying find the best buffalo chicken pizza that Pittsburgh has to offer.</p>
